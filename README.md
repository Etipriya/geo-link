## Project Charter

Geo link is a project which is build on an idea of connecting people in such tough times. The high-level planning included a documentation of the requirements and creating a mock-up of the website page and extended pages.

**Key requirement** - tasks, roles and responsibilities were allotted at the starting of the project. Two people were doing HTML and CSS. Rest were searching for the API's to be used. We used:

- Wire frames - Mock flow
- Mock ups - Adobe CS
- Frontend - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Zurb Foundation, Fontawesome
- Backend - Jquery, Foursquare API, Google places API, local storage

## User Journeys

> Make a search - location and interest

> View more information about a single venue.

> Add/remove your favorite venues.

> View events within 50 miles of a venue.

## Project Retrospective

Geo link is a wonderful platform which helps people communicate and meetup easily. It depends on the interests and various activities which everyone used to do. Geo link is a handy guide wrapped up in an interactive app which brings back multiple results with proper location, map and venue, for a single search.

We all learned a lot during this project. It helped us understand the usage of various API's, foundation for CSS design, local storage and also coding the JS by using JQuery. This project could be improved by adding more details about the events that will be happening in near future and giving a reminder to every individual for the same.

**Lessons learnt** : We learned about various things:

> Related to API - We looked into influence of an API on the project.

> Foursquare - It will be deprecated in a week and it lacked certain elements and it was difficult to use.

> Ticket Master API - This will also be deprecated.

> Google Maps - We got a problem to use google maps as GitHub pages doesn't recognize google map.

> Sass application - This has not been recoganized, we need to implement it in other applications.

//Every project is a learning opportunity. What went well? What could be improved next time? After you conclude the project, sit together with your team and do a project retrospective. Document your lessons learned in a separate document and use it as a reference for your next project.//
